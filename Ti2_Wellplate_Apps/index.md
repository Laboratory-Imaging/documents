# Wellplate applications in NIS-Elements software

1. Setup Nikon Ti2 microscope and NIS-Elements software for Wellplate applications  
   
   - [**"Full" setup**, typically used for research on known cell lines (see below) with fully equipped Ti2 system. It enables to use full set of the software functionalities.](system_setup_full.md)
  
        AI functions has been trained for these cell lines:  
        **A431, BSC-1, CHOK1, Cos7, HeLa, HepG2, HT29, J774.1, Neuro2a, iPSC derived Neurons**

   - [A setup where Cells.ai does not work, typically research on an tissue or a different cell line then those mentioned above. This setup is also useful in cases where some of the "Full" hw specification is not met, e.g. special condenser rings are not mounted.](system_setup_no-overview.md)
